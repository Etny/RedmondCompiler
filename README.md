(This project was made as a programming excercise, so it's not designed to actually be used. The compiler does not support many of C#'s features like structs, interfaces, generic methods, lamba expressions, linq, etc.) 

# Usage

1. Use the `compiledec -i (input file) -o (output file)` command to compile a .dec file into a .parse, which can be used to actually compile files.
2. Use the `compile -i (input file/directory) -o (output file) -p (parse file)` commmand to compile a single .cs file or all .cs files in a folder into CIL
